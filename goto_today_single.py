# If there is a something like "/projects/larc/2016-fueleap", then I want
# the journal to be in 2016-fueleap. Add in "metaproj" list in the settings to
# account for these.

# So directory structure is:

# sublime project folder/projects/(metaproject)/project/year/year.md
# if metaproject is in "subproj" list in settings

# 2017-12-21
# If there is a directory: /projects/subprojects/year/year.md and the
# subproj switch is set, the entry will go in the subproject's journal
# instead of the top-level journal.

# Also hard-coding structure as above (doing away with root journal
# designation in settings.

# New approach - had so many blank entries - particularly in project-
# specific journals - so now this creates a day header if one isn't there
# for the current day. So I plan to use this with an otherwise empty file
# so there won't be headers for empty days.

# Assumes single year journal page generated by new_year_single.py
# Clean up code - move function out from under class definition

# Got tired of not having the cursor in the right place. Added logic at
# end of the file to add lines if needed and place the cursor there.
